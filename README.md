# PlainsAndDepressions

Taks:
Given a two-dimensional array (matrix) containing only 0 and 1. 
The matrix represents the ground, where 0 is a depression, 1 is a plain. 
Depressions can be of different sizes, they are organized by connecting adjacent cells from above or below, not diagonally.
It is necessary to write a function that will return the sizes of all valleys in ascending order.

This code can work with Jagged Arrays also
